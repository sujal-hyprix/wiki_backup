Here is Table 3.1, titled "Failure Condition Severity, Probabilities, and Levels," formatted in Markdown for easy copying and pasting.

### Markdown Code


| Severity Classification | Potential Failure Condition Effect | Likelihood of Occurrence | Exposure Per Flight Hour (Part 25) | Assurance Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Catastrophic** | Failure conditions, which would result in multiple fatalities, usually with the loss of the airplane | Extremely improbable | 1E−9 | A |
| **Hazardous/ Severe major** | Failure conditions, which would reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the flight crew to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be:<br>• A large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities<br>• Physical distress or excessive workload such that the flight crew cannot be relied upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely<br>• Serious or fatal injury to a relatively small number of the occupants other than the flight crew | Extremely remote | 1E−7 | B |
| **Major** | Failure conditions, which would reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be a significant reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities, a significant increase in crew workload or in conditions impairing crew efficiency, discomfort to the flight crew, or physical distress to passengers or cabin crew, possibly including injuries | Remote | 1E−5 | C |
| **Minor** | Failure conditions, which would not significantly reduce airplane safety and which involve crew actions that are well within their capabilities. Minor failure conditions may include a slight reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; a slight increase in crew workload, such as routine flight plan changes; or some physical discomfort to passengers or cabin crew | Reasonably probable | 1E−3 | D |
| **No safety effect** | Failure conditions that would have no effect on safety; e.g., failure conditions that would not affect the operational capability of the airplane or increase crew workload | Probable | 1.0 | E |
