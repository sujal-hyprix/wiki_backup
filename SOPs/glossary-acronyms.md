# Glossary of DO-178C and Safety-Critical Software Terms

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Airborne System Database** | Databases used by an airborne system and approved as part of the type design... may influence paths executed through the executable object code, activate/deactivate components, or be used as computational data. |
| **Application Program Interface (API)** | A formal set of software calls and routines that can be referenced by an application program in order to access supporting system or network services. |
| **Assurance Level** | The degree of confidence that a data element is not corrupted while stored or in transit (Specific to DO-200A aeronautical data). |
| **Condition** | A Boolean expression containing no Boolean operators except for the unary operator (NOT). |
| **Configuration Identification** | The process that identifies items to be controlled, establishes identification schemes for the items and their versions, and establishes the tools and techniques to be used in acquiring and managing controlled items. |
| **Control Coupling** | The manner or degree by which one software component influences the execution of another software component. |
| **Data Coupling** | The dependence of a software component on data not exclusively under the control of that software component. |
| **Deactivated Code** | Executable Object Code (or data) that is traceable to a requirement and, by design, is either (a) not intended to be executed/used (e.g., unused legacy code), or (b) is only executed/used in certain configurations (e.g., enabled by a hardware pin). |
| **Dead Code** | Executable Object Code (or data) which exists as a result of a software development error but cannot be executed (code) or used (data) in any operational configuration of the target computer environment. It is *not* traceable to a system or software requirement. |
| **Decision** | A Boolean expression composed of conditions and zero or more Boolean operators. If a condition appears more than once in a decision, each occurrence is a distinct condition. |
| **Decision Coverage** | Every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once and every decision in the program has taken on all possible outcomes at least once. |
| **Derived Requirements** | Requirements produced by the software development processes which (a) are not directly traceable to higher level requirements, and/or (b) specify behavior beyond that specified by the system requirements or the higher level software requirements. |
| **Design Model** | A model that prescribes software component internal data structures, data flow, and/or control flow. It includes low-level requirements and/or architecture. |
| **Development Assurance** | All of those planned and systematic actions used to substantiate, at an adequate level of confidence, that errors in requirements, design, and implementation have been identified and corrected such that the system satisfies the applicable certification basis. |
| **Equivalence Class** | The partition of the input domain of a program such that a test of a representative value of the class is equivalent to a test of other values of the class. |
| **Error** | With respect to software, a mistake in requirements, design, or code. |
| **Extraneous Code** | Code (or data) that is not traceable to any system or software requirement. An example is legacy code that was incorrectly retained. (Note: Dead code is a specific type of extraneous code). |
| **Failure** | The inability of a system or system component to perform a required function within specified limits. |
| **Fault** | A manifestation of an error in software. A fault, if it occurs, may cause a failure. |
| **Field-Loadable Software (FLS)** | Software that can be loaded without removing the system or equipment from its installation. |
| **Formal Methods** | Descriptive notations and analytical methods used to construct, develop, and reason about mathematical models of system behavior. A formal method is a formal analysis carried out on a formal model. |
| **High-Level Requirements (HLR)** | Software requirements developed from analysis of system requirements, safety-related requirements, and system architecture. |
| **Independence** | Separation of responsibilities which ensures the accomplishment of objective evaluation. For verification, it is achieved when the activity is performed by a person/tool other than the developer of the item. For SQA, it includes the authority to ensure corrective action. |
| **Low-Level Requirements (LLR)** | Software requirements developed from high-level requirements, derived requirements, and design constraints from which Source Code can be directly implemented without further information. |
| **Model** | An abstract representation of a given set of aspects of a system that is used for analysis, verification, simulation, code generation, or any combination thereof. |
| **Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC)** | Every point of entry/exit invoked at least once, every condition in a decision taken all possible outcomes, every decision taken all possible outcomes, and each condition shown to independently affect that decision’s outcome. |
| **Object-Oriented Technology** | A software development technique in which a system or component is expressed in terms of objects and connections between those objects. |
| **Parameter Data Item** | A set of data that, when in the form of a Parameter Data Item File, influence the behavior of the software without modifying the Executable Object Code and that is managed as a separate configuration item. |
| **Partitioning** | A technique for providing isolation between software components to contain and/or isolate faults and potentially reduce the effort of the software verification process. |
| **Product Service History** | A continuous period of time during which the software is operated within a known environment, and during which successive failures are recorded. |
| **Reverse Engineering** | The process of developing higher level software data from existing software data (e.g., developing Source Code from object code, or High-Level Requirements from Low-Level Requirements). |
| **Robust Partitioning** | A mechanism for assuring the intended isolation of independent aircraft operational functions residing in shared computing resources in all circumstances, including hardware and programming errors. |
| **Safety-Critical Software** | Software whose use in a system can result in unacceptable risk. |
| **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** | The systematic activities providing evidence of the fitness for use of the total software product... consists of a set of auditing and reporting functions that assess the effectiveness and completeness of quality control actions. |
| **Software Tool** | A computer program used to help develop, test, analyze, produce, or modify another program, its data, or its documentation. |
| **Specification Model** | A model representing high-level requirements that provides an abstract representation of functional, performance, interface, or safety characteristics... it does not prescribe a specific software implementation or architecture. |
| **Statement Coverage** | Every statement in the program has been invoked at least once. |
| **Tool Qualification** | The process used to gain certification credit for a software tool whose output is not verified, when the tool eliminates, reduces, or automates processes required by DO-178C. |
| **Traceability** | The evidence of association between requirements, design, code, and verification data (e.g., bidirectional tracing between system requirements and high-level software requirements). |
| **User-Modifiable Software (UMS)** | Software intended for modification without review by the certification authority, the airframe manufacturer, or the equipment vendor, if within the modification constraints established during the original certification project. |
| **Validation** | The process of ensuring that requirements are correct and complete. |
| **Verification** | The evaluation of the outputs of a process to ensure correctness and consistency with respect to the inputs and standards provided to that process. |
